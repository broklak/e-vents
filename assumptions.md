# Assumptions 

My assumption of this assignment is there are ticket purchases / tickets purchased at one event in several locations.

Each event has a start date and expiration date along with any type of ticket sold such as Free, Premium, Regular is the sample I initiated on this assignment.

Tickets purchased by customers can be purchased offline / online through a system that is connected to the web service puchase ticket.
